                            <p> Nurses what do you think of authorized electronic monitoring in long-term care facilities? If you work in a state that allows it, how has it impacted residents care? How has it impacted you as a nurse? In short some states are allowing electronic monitoring or cameras in the rooms of the residents. What is the good and the bad of allowing this? Michigan has a bill, Senate Bill No. 77, that if passed will allow such devices. There a few requirements like resident to pay for the service, signs. Via Michigan NORML: Senator Arlan Meekhof has just introduced a bill that would gut the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act just passed by voters. Meekhof wants to eliminate home grows completely! Read the bill here: http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2018-SIB-1243.pdf. Hey everyone! This post is for people who are willing to pay for a quality transcription, so if this is not you, you can stop reading! I can transcribe that piece you just can't get out of your head and just NEED the sheet music for! I charge USD per minute of piano music, so a 3 minute song will run you about . Rates are based on the length of the piece you want transcribed and the number of instruments in your requested arrangement. Here's how I do it: I will transcribe the whole. It says is senate bill No. 305 that "1931 PA 328, MCL 750.226a, is repealed". That would mean that automatic knives are legal. Does anyone know for sure if they are legal or not ? Senate Bill- 1931 PA 328- http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0z4ml33l5otdx3lb0d41v2px))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObjectampobjectname=mcl-750-226a. I've been playing around with customising the colours in my terminal. My .bash_profile currently has the line `export LSCOLORS=gxFxCxDxBxegedabagacgx`. Unfortunately, one thing that this does is that some files are bold red, and others are normal-weighted white. As far as I can tell, my LSCOLORS is making executables bold red. Some of the files that are appearing bold red are not executables. Or at least they shouldn't be. I've got some .pdf files that are appearing 
Discussion Update: I've been made to stop and think, and be less pessimistic about people's motives. However, I still need convincing, because I don't understand how people don't see the harm, nor correct their behavior when told it harms in the case of genuine motives. Why not listen, and seek and heed advice on better ways to help? My view has overall not yet changed. Get me on this point: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/aspwuj/cmv_people_that_fat_shame_to_help_overweightobese/. What do you all think about this one? Popular FB post I keep seeing in my feed( I have alot of antivax friends). amp#x200B; 1. A pesticide common in the 1800’s was called Paris Green. A green liquid because it was a combination of copper and arsenic or lead and arsenic. Some of the most toxic substances known to humankind. This super toxin was also used as a dye, in many items, including wall paper and paint. It was the sole focus of murder mystery novels at the time, as arsenic Beyond the anti-Hereditarian fallacies laid out in Gottfredson (2009) ( there are many others. I will outline a short collection of these here. Some pieces linked may themselves be fine, though they're variously misused on Reddit and elsewhere, and that will be addressed. These come primarily from /u/stairway-to-kevin, who has used them at various times. It is likely that Kevin doesn't make up his own arguments, because he appears not to understand. So I saw this (https://www.dezeen.com/2018/12/18/homelessness-london-movie-tottenham-court-road/) article today, which again illustrates the discrimination homeless men face under law in London (and the UK in general.) The article interviews two homeless men. You'll notice that although one of them mentions homeless women, the vast majority of people and pictures in the article are of men. The first, Declan, says: gtThat was a year ago, yeah yeah. It was a housing association I've been seeing Tucker-Drob amp Bates 2015 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4749462/) get cited a lot lately as some sort of definitive proof of lower heritability of iq among lower SES in the U.S. I wanted to write this post to provide a brief new review of the evidence and list an issue or two with T-D amp B. First and foremost, it's clear that the SR hypothesis has consistently failed to replicate in first world countries outside of the U.S. This was demonstrated I've been doing some research and discovered chemicals that attenuate meth neurotoxicity that I don't hear anyone talking about. This information isn't entirely practical as many of the chems are hard to obtain, but it should be interesting for anyone who loves to learn about neuropharmacology - specifically relating to meth. In each case I'll provide a brief explanation of the mechanism by which meth exerts its neurotoxicity and how the drug attenuates it. Elevated levels of dimethylargin.
